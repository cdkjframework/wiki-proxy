# FrameWiKi Network Proxy

Wiki Framework Internal Network Penetration Tool
*********************

## What does FrameWiKi Network Proxy do?

-Users are required to provide hardware support services, computers, and deployed intranet penetration tools on their
own.
-We can provide intranet penetration services for TCP protocol types, including but not limited to HTTP (s), database
connection, SSH, and other protocols.
-Support HTTPS and HTTP protocols and application interaction methods (HTTPS is recommended for greater security).
-Support unencrypted, control port encrypted interaction, and data encrypted interaction methods.
-The main service scenario requires opening up internal network applications to the public network, such as WeChat mini
program development and debugging, payment callbacks, etc.
-Support HTTP reverse proxy based on host; The target is still an internal network application, but the target
application can be selected based on the host field in the HTTP protocol header (note: it was only suggested by someone)
The issue of HTTP listening on a unified port and accessing it using a domain name, and the added value of this feature;
There is no load function, this is internal network penetration, not
nginxï¼Œ It is not recommended to use it directly in production, and those that require load can be implemented by
themselves
